				To garner the right experience in your field, No one wants to employ the bookish type that has no first hand experience of what they do. <br>An appealing resume is one that has what it takes to convince the HR team of the firm you’re applying to that you're the best candidate for the job<br> And what really incite the HR guys about your CV? Apparently, not just academic performance, although this will act like a leverage on to meeting with the HR guys, but to get the job; experience is important.
			</p>
			<p class="nysc-content-main-head">how do one get these experiences</p>
			<p class="nysc-content-main-desc">
				The school system is structured in a way that if you’re not proactive, you may not have any experience about your so-called course of study.<br> However, your service year should be adequately planned to get experience of what you study. NYSC phase should be a building phase for you, where you try to improve on your resume. And this is done by doing so many volunteering work that is in line with your career.
			</p>
			<p class="nysc-content-main-head">recommendation</p>
			<p class="nysc-content-main-desc">
				According to the Cambridge dictionary; recommendation is a suggestion that something is good or suitable for a particular purpose or job.<br> People lose jobs because of poor recommendations. Intern is a time to convince everyone around you that you are fit for the job in case there is an opening here or there.
			</p>
			<p class="nysc-content-main-head">where to intern</p>
			<p class="nysc-content-main-desc">
				The beauty of this is that you can intern in any organization. One thing about all these firms is that most of them are short staffed but they don't have good financial capacity to pay another employee. So if you object to an intern without a pay they will surely give you a go ahead.
